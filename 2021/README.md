# Advent of code - 2021

Advent of code is a coding challenge run in December every year. Developers at Tobii, where I work, participated and set up a local leader board. I tagged along and tried to solve a couple of the problems. Next year I'll get going earlier and try to complete more problems.

## The problem:
Everyday poses two new problems. See source to have a look at them.

The problems consist of a description and an input data set. If needed, the input is saved in a seperate file. If it is a bit more manageble, the input is saved in the solution file.
